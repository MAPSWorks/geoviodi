This program offers a quick viewer for gps-related files. So far only Gpx format is supported.

It uses two components:
  * [QMapControl](http://www.medieninf.de/qmapcontrol/) to display maps
  * Qwt library by the Qwt project (http://qwt.sf.net) to draw graphs

It is tested under Windows and Linux (Arch), it should require Qt>= 4.5.
